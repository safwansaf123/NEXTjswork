 <h6 className="mt-4">A Promise in JavaScript is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.</h6>

<li>Pending: The initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.</li>
<li>Fulfilled: The operation was completed successfully.</li>
<li>Rejected: The operation failed.</li>
